MattockFS: C++ port
===================

Untill work on MattockFS is concluded, work on the C++ port will not start.

This repo will in the near future start holding efforts towards the goal of porting the MattockFS computer forensics file-system from python to C++. The goal of this port should primarily be performance and schalability improbements.
